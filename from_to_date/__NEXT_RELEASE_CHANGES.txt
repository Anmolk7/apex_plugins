- Add an absolute min/max dates
- IE 7/8/9 Fix

Dear,
 
I have recently downloaded and tried the Clarifit from to datepicker. I must say I really like the concept. I am currently working with a client that only uses IE8. I develop in Chrome, but test in IE, after testing the folowing error popped up: "Expected identifier String or Number". In IE this usually means there is a "," somewhere, where it shouldn't be. I found two in the code:
 
One at      
showOn: 'button'
      },
    datePickerType: '', //from or to
  },
So this becomes:
      showOn: 'button'
      },
    datePickerType: '' //from or to
  },
And one at:
    uiw._values = {
      shortYearCutoff: 30, //roll over year
    };
becomes:
    uiw._values = {shortYearCutoff: 30 //roll over year
    };
 
After editing these two out, it ran withouth any further problems.
 
Perhaps you were already aware of this problem, but if not I hope this information will help you if you decide to release another version.
And again, thank you for releasing such a handy plug-in.
